# Brass: Birminham - Boardgame foamcore organiser system

## Introduction
If you hate spending ages setting up [this fantastic game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224517/brass-birmingham), then this organiser might be for you. The biggest time-saver is afforded by the player trays, but the rest of the trays will also speed up set up and tear down.

This insert houses all game components from the standard version of the game (ie: no deluxe components). It comfortably supports sleeved cards, and the box lid will shut *completely*.

These plans are designed to be used as stencils for cutting, but I recommend you permanently stick the stencil for the base to your foamcore. The bases of each tray will then have artwork on it showing what goes in that tray.  

## Materials required

You will need:
* 6mm foam core (that was sold as 5mm)
* box cutter
* exacto knife

**Note:** The 5 mm foam core I had access to was actually 6mm when you take in to account the card glued to each side of the foam. So this set of plans is actually designed for 6mm foam core (that was sold as 5mm).

## Software used

The software needed is all free and/or open source, and available on most operating systems.

* [FreeCAD 19](https://www.freecadweb.org/) - 3D drawings of the trays and their parts, and generating 1:1 2D plans.
* [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) - To enhance the plans exported from FreeCAD making them use the foamcore more efficiently. This means less cuts are required to create the trays.
* [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/) - To prepare the manual and stencils in an easy to print format.
